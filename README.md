# Rock, Paper, Scissors
A classic hand-held game typically played between you and your best friend, now available to play against a computer opponent. One of my favorite games to decide who gets to sit in the front seat, or who decides what's for dinner, rock, paper, scissors will always be a timeless classic in my eyes.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Basic design elements with HTML and CSS. Using JavaScript to navigate the win/loss/tie logic, updating the score, and for redirecting to pages. The score, player choice, and computer choice is stored using session storage so that whenever the browser is opened, a new game and score is started, but players can play multiple rounds at one time and still keep track of their score. Player choice and computer choice variables are stored in session storage, as mentioned, and used to adjust the win/loss/tie DOM with their respective images and color designs.

## Optimizations

There are many other adaptations fo this game which can be expanded to include more choices. Also could use a framework like React to allow for easier tracking of player choice, computer choice, and score using React hooks and states.

1. Implement more choices.
2. Use React framework for more seamless design and implementation of JavaScript variables and their DOM element rendering.
